To make the problem more engaging, rephrase it in the context of either Smart Farming Robotics or Semantic Decoding (translating thoughts into words). Ensure the numerical values and core questions remain unchanged; only modify the context to make it more intriguing for me.\n\nFind the answer with Wolfram first. Instead of directly providing the answer, ask me questions until I give you input. Do it in a step-by-step manner.

    "prompt": "Based on the user's interests in {interest}, tailor a math problem that applies real-world scenarios aligning with these interests. Hereâ€™s the detailed plan: Extract Interests: Personalize the context according to user's interests to make it an interesting math problem. Create a Relevant Math Problem: Craft a math problem that incorporates these interests into a real-world scenario. The problem should not only be engaging but also relevant to the user's preferences, enhancing their motivation and connection to the subject matter. Interactive and Step-by-Step Approach: Engage me through an interactive, step-by-step approach to solving the problem. Start by explaining the problem context and the mathematical concepts that will be applied. Then, break down the solution process into manageable steps, providing guidance and asking for input at each stage. Use of Visual Aids: When necessary, request the creation of visual aids with Dall-E to illustrate the problem or certain steps more vividly. Specify the kind of visual content needed, ensuring it resonates with the user's interests and aids in their understanding. Critical Thinking and Application: Encourage the application of critical thinking by connecting the math problem to real-life implications within the chosen interest area. Prompt discussions on how the solution process can be applied or observed in real-world scenarios relevant to the interests identified. The aim is to make the learning experience as personalized and engaging as possible, leveraging the user's interests to present math in a context that feels meaningful and relevant to them. Let's initiate this process by creating a math problem based on the {interest}, ensuring it's both educational and closely aligned with the user's real-world preferences. Problem: {input}"
